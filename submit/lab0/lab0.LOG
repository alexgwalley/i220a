       In  the  1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.  In[m
       the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the current directory.  In the[m
       3rd  and  4th  forms, create links to each TARGET in DIRECTORY.  Create[m
       hard links by default, symbolic links  with  [1m--symbolic[0m.   By  default,[m
       each  destination  (name  of  new link) should not already exist.  When[m
       creating hard links, each TARGET must exist.  Symbolic links  can  hold[m
       arbitrary  text;  if  later resolved, a relative link is interpreted in[m
       relation to its parent directory.[m
[m
       Mandatory arguments to long options are  mandatory  for  short  options[m
       too.[m
